Public highlights of Azadeh Golduzian’s biomarker modeling and genomic annotation research

# Azadeh Golduzian — Research Highlights

Welcome! This repository showcases selected public-facing components of my research as a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Biology at the University of New Mexico. My work bridges plasma-based biomarker modeling for Alzheimer’s disease and large-scale genomic annotation.

## 🔬 Areas of Focus

- **Alzheimer’s Biomarkers**  
  Modeling pTau217, Aβ42/40, cognitive cut-points, and novel T-score thresholds  
  (see `alzheimers_biomarkers/`)

- **Genomic Annotation**  
  Functional mapping of 2M+ variants from UK Biobank and All of Us  
  (see `genomics_annotation/`)

- **Public Presentations**  
  Posters and slide decks from invited talks and symposia  
  (see `presentations/`)

## 🛡️ Note
This repository contains only public-facing files. No raw data, private identifiers, or restricted materials are included.
